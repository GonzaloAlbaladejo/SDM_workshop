This code provides a quick and easy hands-on introduction to species distribution and niche modelling. The code contains all the different steps to perform these analysis:
  1. Data gathering and prepartion
  2. Species data adquisition, processing and clean-up
  3. Exploratory niche analysis using the environmental niche factor analysis (ENFA)
  4. A diversity of supervised and unsupervised statisticall methods for the analysis of species distributions and habitat suitability
  5.
